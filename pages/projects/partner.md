*Providing a path forward for the former incarcerated*

## My role
- UX/UI Design

## The Challenge

Reducing recidivism is a complex and varied problem. Without a community support system, achieving that goal of staying free is much more daunting.

(Company name redacted) was tasked to **build a web app that would allow inmates to search and sign up for community services** &mdash; providing a conduit between the inmates and services within the community such as education, food banks, social workers, etc. In addition to this, the prison staff and case workers need to have oversight of where those who are incarcerated may be at a certain time and which of these community offerings they are involved in. So, if an inmate is admitted to a class &mdash; and allowed to leave the facility for this class &mdash; the staff needs to have a digital record of what time the person left and who with.

## The Work
Our, small cross-functional team collaborated with the client plus former inmates to better understand the needs and requirements. Through hours of discovery and exploration of key relationships between those who would use the tool, mapping of needs and experiences, and identifying data constraints we delivered an exceptional tool for our client.

### Our core features of focus
- **Clear and accessible searches.** People who are incarcerated need the ability to research opportunities and resources in the community. They also need to be able to share the info of these resources with a family member outside of the facility, providing a stronger connection for families allows for increased chances of success.
- **System oversight.** Facility staff required oversight of the activities (offsite visits and communications) at all times so providing various levels of admin privilege and system access to the wardens, officers, and case workers was crucial.
- **Access and communication.** The community organizations that provide services, case workers for the incarcerated, and the incarcerated all needed access to the app with a variety of use cases and entry points to the system.

### Accessibility
Another critical point was the need for the design to be **ccessible, flexible, and performant**. Many who are incarcerated would be accessing the app on devices with less than optimal operating systems and internet access. So the app must accomodate for the constraints that these phones and tablets provided. Our team worked with our engineers to focus on building within this constraint but also our designs needed to be lightweight and flexible &mdash; considering when resources may not load optimally. 

Lastly, a significant percentage of people who are incarcerated have learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, or have limited use of vision or motor skills. Given this, the app needed was built prioritizing inclusive experiences. This is exemplified in patterns such as: include a label with icons, proper form design, plain language, etc. 

## The Outcome
While I can't show the final app for NDA reasons, below are early prototypes I designed during our ideation phase.
