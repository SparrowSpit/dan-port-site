# About
Learn more about how I approach [this site's accessibility](/accessibility)
I design, write a little bit of front-end code, and spend time helping designers and developers create more inclusive digital products. I have worked across various industries but currently work with [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/) as a UX Designer and Accessibility Specialist, building digital services that help the federal government better serve people.

   Feel free to <a href="mailto:dbivins☛REMOVE-THIS☚@protonmail.com?subject=Accessibility issue">email me directly</a> to set up a time to chat. </p>

## Speaking
Occasionally I give talks on accessibility.

- The most recent was for AIGA Los Angeles on ["Being a Web A11y"](https://losangeles.aiga.org/event/being-a-web-a11y/).
- I presented at [Ad Hoc Accessibility Camp 2020](https://adhoc.team/2020/04/20/accessibility-camp-2020/).

## Writing
- I was fortunate enough to be apart of an amazing team that wrote: <a href="https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/">The Ad Hoc Accessibility Beyond Compliance Playbook</a>
- As a co-author, [The right benchmarks](https://adhoc.team/2021/11/30/right-benchmarks/)
- [An intro into designing for accessibility](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/an-intro-to-designing-for-accessibility)

## Non-work
Outside of working, I have become an avid trail runner and also have been involved in a couple very different musical projects for several years.
